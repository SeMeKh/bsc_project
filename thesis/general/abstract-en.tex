Testing is one of the main means of achieving higher quality of software. Behavior-Driven Development is an industry-wide popular techniques in effectively integrating testing with development process.

In this article, we will first examine BDD and other similar techniques in software testing.

Next, we will propose and implement a BDD testing framework, designed based on the idea of decoupling scenarios from tests. This framework should supposedly help the software developer in writing higher quality tests, as well as decreasing the maintenance cost of such test suites.

And at last, we will implement a sample system, and use our testing framework toward writing tests for our sample application.
